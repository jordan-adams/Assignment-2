# Homework 2 Problem 1
# Jordan Adams

c = 1
x = (input("What is the distance in light years?", ))
print("Distance of",x,"light years")

v = (input("What is the fraction of the speed of light?", ))
print("The fraction of the speed of light is", v)

# Input for the requried variables of distance and fraction of the 
# speed of light

gamma = (1-(((v*c)**2)/(c**2)))**-0.5

time = (x/v)

timeprime = (gamma)*(time)

print("The time in years that the spaceship takes to reach its destination in \
the rest frame of an observer on Earth is", timeprime)
print("The time in years that the spaceship takes to reach its detination as  \
perceived by a passenger on board the ship is", time)

# I took the stationary frame to be S' and the frame of reference for the 
# spaceship to be S => t would be the time that passes for the spaceship, and
# t' would be for an observer on Earth.
